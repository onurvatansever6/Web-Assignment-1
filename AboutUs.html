        <p>There can be no watch house less in need of an introduction than Rolex. It is a brand whose name echoes beyond the boundaries of our industry. Synonymous with luxury, interchangeable with quality, imbued with a heritage that no amount of money, spin, or PR stunts can synthesize, Rolex almost occupies its own territory. Sometime during the last decade, the brand founded by a wide-eyed Hans Wilsdorf in 1905 has transmogrified. It is no longer a watch brand, but rather a phenomenon. The rules do not apply to this relentless juggernaut as it rolls over all-comers. No, when it comes to playing the game, Rolex has a distinct, insurmountable advantage: It wrote the rule book.
            Rolex SA is the leading luxury watch manufacturer in the world producing over 2,000 watches per day that generate sales of over $7 billion dollars each year. The Swiss based Company manufactures, services and distributes wristwatches under the Rolex and Tudor brand through authorized dealers.  It was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, England and was recently ranked 57 on the worlds most powerful brands.  The original name of the company was Wilsdorf and Davis, and in 1919, operations were relocated to Geneva, Switzerland. The brand today produces industry icons such as the Rolex Submariner, Daytona, and GMT-Master, and competes with other leading luxury watch companies like Patek Philippe, Omega, and Panerai and sponsors many major sports events in tennis, golf, yachting, and racing.
